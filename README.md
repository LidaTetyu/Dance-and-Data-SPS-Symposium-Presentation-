# Moving Through Math: SPS Symposium Presentation
Latin Ballroom Dancing Through the Lens of Mathematics

This repository contains my presentation for the 2025 SPS Symposium, Moving Through Math, where I explore Latin and Ballroom dance using mathematical and analytical frameworks.

The central premise: math is the science of patterns and dance is structured pattern execution.

### Fractions

- Tempo and beats per minute
- Time signatures and musical notes
- Step timing (Slow = 2 beats, Quick = 1 beat)
- Increasing choreographic complexity through fractional timing structures

### Graphing

- Modeling timing distributions within basic steps
- Comparing average beat duration across dances (Rumba, Cha Cha, Tango)
- Tracking spatial displacement from a starting point

### Calculus

- Using derivatives to analyze rise and fall in Waltz
- Modeling height as a function of beats
-Interpreting rate of change to inform technique execution

### Geometry & Angles

- Bird’s-eye spatial patterns of basic steps
- Floor alignment (45°, 90°, 180°, etc.)
- Foot turnout and rotational mechanics
- Oriented curves and directional travel across the floor

### Physics (Kinematics)

- Motion analysis of spin mechanics
- Differences between world champions and national-level dancers
- Pelvic velocity, trunk rotation, and momentum sequencing

### Graph Theory & Data Modeling

- Designing a directed graph model of beginner Waltz steps
- Defining nodes (steps) and edges (valid transitions)
- Converting the model into Cypher
- Generating choreography using graph database logic

### Purpose

This project demonstrates that artistic systems like dance can be formalized using mathematical structure without reducing their expressive depth. It also serves as a bridge between my background in statistics and data science and my lifelong involvement in ballroom dance.

### Personal Outcomes

- Deepened understanding of both dance and mathematics
- Built a foundational graph-based choreography tool for future expansion
- Developed new ways to teach dance concepts through analytical frameworks
